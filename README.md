# YODA-Real-Time-Edge-Detection

This repository contains the contents of Teams 3's YODA project which is the academic investigation into the capability of an FPGA implementation of a real-time edge detection algorithm. A sequncial version of this has been developed using Python and will be used as a golden standard benchmark as a means of comparing the performance of the FPGA implementation.
